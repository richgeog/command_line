The 'wc' command can be used in the shell to count words in a file.

You can append wc with a few extra letters and these will count different things.

-l will count the amount of lines in a file
-c will count the size of the file in bytes
-w will count the amount of words in the file
-m will count the amount of characters in the file

an example of how to use 'wc' is:

$ wc -l file_name
